# BootcampFinder
### backend api created using nodejs and express

I used mongoDB and mongoose as the database, 3 models Users, Bootcamp & Courses</br>
authentication is handled with jsonwebtoken </br>
I used custom error handling, async await to create the routes,  </br>
pagination and advance filtering is also supported</br>
I used a geocoding tool to retrieve search results within a given radius </br>
taking advantage of the 2dsphere features supported by mongodb
